His chief de-light it is to set<BR>
A good example: shine or wet<BR>
He rises ere the break of day,<BR>
And starts his break-fast right away.<BR>
His food has such a way to go,&mdash;<BR>
His throat's so very long,&mdash;and so<BR>
An early break-fast he must munch<BR>
To get it down ere time for lunch.<BR>

OB-SERVE the Cat up-on this page.<BR>
Phil-os-o-phers in ev-er-y age,<BR>
The ver-y _wis-est_ of the wise,<BR>
Have tried her mind to an-a-lyze<BR>
In vain, for noth-ing can they learn.<BR>
She baf-fles them at ev-er-y turn<BR>
Like Mis-ter Ham-let in the play.<BR>
She leads their rea-son-ing a-stray;<BR>
She feigns an in-ter-est in string<BR>
Or yarn or any roll-ing thing.<BR>
Un-like the Dog, she does not care<BR>
With com-mon Man her thoughts to share.<BR>
She teach-es us that in life's walk<BR>
'T is bet-ter to let oth-ers talk,<BR>
And lis-ten while _they_ say in-stead<BR>
The fool-ish things we might have said.<BR>

HERE is the Dog.  Since time be-gan,<BR>
The Dog has been the friend of MAN,<BR>
The Dog loves MAN be-cause he shears<BR>
His coat and clips his tail and ears.<BR>
MAN loves the Dog be-cause he'll stay<BR>
And lis-ten to his talk all day,<BR>
And wag his tail and show de-light<BR>
At all his jokes, how-ev-er trite.<BR>
His bark is far worse than his bite,<BR>
So peo-ple say.  They may be right;<BR>
Yet if to make a choice I had,<BR>
I'd choose his bark, how-ev-er bad.<BR>
